# Flight Delay Prediction Project
This repo contains all the files and codes for Flight Delay Prediction Project. Every year a lot of flights delay occurs and are among the biggest nightmares for travelers. In this project, I intend to use several months/years of flight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to find out which airlines are the best and worst performers, and which airline performs the best given a particular route. Additionally, I have also included weather data to take into consideration.
